Changes to KPP-2.2.3, for use with the Mistra model
===================================================

Author: J. Bock (josue.bock@meteo.fr)

1. In main directory:
   1. create `bin/` directory.
   2. edit `Makefile.defs` according to KPP instructions.

2. In `src/` directory:
   1. edit `code_f77.c` and decrease the number of written columns (integer case) from 12 to 11 (or less):
      - `maxCols = 11`
      - `if (((i+1) % 11 == 0 ...`
      - comments starting with `!` instead of `C` (optional, unactivated)
   2. `code_f90.c` from R. Sander's version.
   3. edit `gdata.h`, increase `MAX_EQN` (5000, or more) and `MAX_SPECIES` (3000, or more).
      After R. Sander changes: also increase `MAX_K` (300).
   4. use `scan.l` from R. Sander's version (dimensions increased to 300, related to change in `gdata.h` here).
   5. edit `scan.y` and increase the dimension of the character variable `str` from 80 to 300.
   6. correct `gen.c` subroutine `GenerateJacReactantProd : allocate integer arrays instead of a declaration`.

3. In `int/` directory, use corrected version of `int/rosenbrock.f`:
   1. `ode_Fun` is not the correct name, replaced by `FunTemplate`.
   2. `ode_Jac` is not the correct name, replaced by `JacTemplate`.

4. In `util/` directory:
   1. use empty version of `UserRateLaws.f`.

Further changes to KPP-2.2.3, after `Forcheck`-ing the code
-----------------------------------------------------------

In `int/rosenbrock.f` file:
1. remove all calls to subroutine `WCOPY`.
2. remove all calls to subroutine `WSCAL`.


Update: 5 March 2017 (J.B.)
===========================

- Bugfix in `src/code_f77.c`: in `F77_DeclareData`, a bug arise if the number of species (or reactions) is a multiple of `max_lines` corrected by adding `if( min < max )`.
- In the same source file: dynamic column filling, to take 3-5 digits into account, and avoid too long files (and too numerous continuation lines).
- Cleaning of the whole source file, according to compilation messages.
- In `src/gen.c`: bugfix to print correct file extension when running KPP, plus cleaning of this file according to compilation messages.
- In `util/sutil.f`: bugfix in subroutine `KppDecomp`: there was already a test to prevent `JVS(...) == 0`, but there were 2 mistakes:
  1. only `nvar` values were tested, not covering the whole `JVS(:)` values.
  2. a strict equality (`== 0`) was used, while `abs < tiny` is safer.
